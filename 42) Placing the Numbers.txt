Place the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 into the eight circles in figure given below, 
in such a way that no number is adjacent to a number that is next to it in the sequence.

For example 1 should not be adjacent to 2 but can be adjacent to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Answer :

Trivial Solution:
Trying for 8!=40320 combination would be tedious task.
 
Smart Solution:
 
The easiest numbers to place are 1 and 8, because each has only one number to which it cannot be adjacent, 
namely, 2 and 7, respectively. ​The hardest circles to fill are those in the middle, as each is adjacent to 
six others.This suggests that we place 1 and 8 in the middle circles. If we place 1 to the left of 8, then 
the only possible positions for 2 and 7 are shown figure below:
