Puzzle :

A dealer has 1000 coins and 10 bags. 
He has to divide the coins over the ten bags so that he can make any number of coins simply by handing over a 
few bags. How must divide his money into the ten bags?
 
Solution:

We can fill coins in the 10 bags in increasing order of 2^n where n varies from 0 – 8, 
filling the last bag with all remaining coins as follows:

1 = 2^0 = 1
2 = 2^1 = 2
3 = 2^2 = 4
4 = 2^3 = 8
5 = 2^4 = 16
6 = 2^5 = 32
7 = 2^6 = 64
8 = 2^7 = 128
9 = 2^8 = 256
10 = remaining coins = 489

Now, the dealer can make any number of coins just by handing over the bags.
as,
number 0f coins needed = some bag 1 + some bag 2 + ….. + some bag n
example:
519 coins = bag 2 + bag 4 + bag 8 + bag 16 + bag 489
