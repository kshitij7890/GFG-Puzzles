Puzzle: 

A man has a medical condition that requires him to take two kinds of pills, call them A and B. 
The man must take exactly one A pill and exactly one B pill each day, or he will die. 
The pills are taken by first dissolving them in water.

The man has a jar of A pills and a jar of B pills. 
One day, as he is about to take his pills, he takes out one A pill from the A jar and puts it in a glass of water. 
Then he accidentally takes out two B pills from the B jar and puts them in the water. 
Now, he is in the situation of having a glass of water with three dissolved pills, one A pill and two B pills. 
Unfortunately, the pills are very expensive, so the thought of throwing out the water with the 3 pills and starting 
over is out of the question. 

How should the man proceed in order to get the right quantity of A and B while not wasting any pills?

Solution :

Step 1: Add one more A pill to the glass and let it dissolve.
Step 2: Take half of the water today and half tomorrow.
