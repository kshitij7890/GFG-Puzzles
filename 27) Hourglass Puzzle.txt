Puzzle: 

Given two hourglass of 4 minutes and 7 minutes, the task is to measure 9 minutes.


Solution:

At 0 minutes: Start both hourglasses at the same time.

At 4 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass runs out and flip it. 7 minutes hourglass is left with 3 minutes.

At 7 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass is left with 1 minute. 7 minutes hourglass runs out and flip it.

At 8 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass runs out and 7 is filled with 6 minutes and 1 minute on the other side. 
              Flip it as the sand is left with 1 minute.

At 9 minutes: 7 minutes hourglass becomes empty from above side.

Hence we measured 9 minutes.
