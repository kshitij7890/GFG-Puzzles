Puzzle :
There are three boxes box1, box2 and box3 containing gold, silver and  mixture of silver and gold respectively.

Each of the three boxes contain a label on them describing the contents.
Mr. Hurricane comes and mess up all labels. Now each box is labeled with the name which it exactly 
doesnâ€™t contain. You are given only one chance to open a box and you should guess all the remaining 
two box contents correctly. Which box will you choose to open keeping in mind that all the three 
boxes are labeled wrong?

(There is a chance of the mixed box having all the gold coins towards the bottom and 
silver filled on the top(or vice versa) to deceive that it is a silver box.


Solution:
Choose the box labeled as mixed.

Explanation:
If the box labeled as mixed is chosen and opened, it can contain gold or silver, cannot contain 
both because the label written is exactly opposite. Say,  If the box contains gold, then two boxes 
will now left to be guessed. Obviously the box labeled as silver contains  mixed.
