Statement:
The game of Tic-Tac-Toe is being played between two players and it is in below state after six moves.
     X O -
     X - -
     O O X
Can you answer following questions?

Who will win the game, O or X?
Which was the sixth mark and at which position?
Assume that both the players are intelligent enough.

 
Solution:
O will win the game. The sixth mark was X in square 9.
 
Explanation:

The 7th mark must be placed in square 5 which is the win situation for both X and O. 
Hence, the 6th mark must be placed in a line already containing two of the opponents marks. 

There are two such possibilities â€“ the 6th mark would have been either O in square 7 or X in square 9.
As we know both the players are intelligent enough, the 6th mark could not be O in square 7. 
Instead, he would have placed O in square 5 and would have won.

Hence, the sixth mark must be X placed in square 9. And the seventh mark will be O. 
Thus O will win the game.
