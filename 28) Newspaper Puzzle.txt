Question : 

A newspaper made of 16 large sheets of paper folded in half. The newspaper has 64 pages altogether. 
The first sheet contains pages 1, 2, 63, 64.
If we pick up a sheet containing page number 45. What are the other pages that this sheet contains?

Answer :

On the back of 45, it is 46. The pages are such that for each page p, 65-p will be also on the same page.

Then,
65-45 = 20
65-46 = 19

So the four pages in this sheet are 19, 20, 45, 46.
